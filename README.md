# Medical Acronym Dictionary

This application uses the [Acromine REST Service] (http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/acromine/rest.html).

> Acromine is an abbreviation dictionary automatically constructed from the whole MEDLINE as of April, 2009. Acromine identifies abbreviation definitions by assuming a word sequence co-occurring frequently with a parenthetical expression to be a potential expanded form.

The application takes in user input in the form of acronyms and returns a list of valid long forms extracted from the U.S. National Library of Medicine's (NLM) premier bibliographic database. As a result, use of the application is targeted at medical short forms.
